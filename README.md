## ðŸ“– Abstract
Computer Vision (CV) applications are undergoing a significant revolution, as they are being applied in previously difficult or impossible areas. This includes object detection and tracking within different environments. The development of CV is closely tied to the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL), which have enabled the creation of powerful algorithms for object tracking and detection. However, these algorithms require significant computational resources and are typically deployed on powerful servers or the cloud. This can be cost-prohibitive and may not be feasible for certain applications or users.  

The proliferation of edge devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, presents a significant opportunity for the deployment of CV applications. However, deploying these algorithms on edge devices is challenging due to computational power, memory, and storage limitations. To tackle these limitations, recent developments in hardware such as Neural Compute Stick (NCS) accelerator make it possible to increase the inference speed and perform offline computations. Nevertheless, the challenge of deploying deep learning algorithms on edge devices still exists.  

This thesis proposed a DL-based model that follows the tracking-by-detection approach to track multiple objects. The model is deployable in edge computing thanks to an optimization phase that enables deploying the YOLOv8 and DeepSORT on devices with limited resources, namely Raspberry Pi. The experiments conducted on a custom dataset showed that the model, in both the normal and tiny versions, obtained good results in comparison with other state-of-the-art traditional algorithms.
